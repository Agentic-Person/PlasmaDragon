## 🔧 **MCP Server Connection Troubleshooting (CRITICAL FOR TOMORROW)**

### **🚨 Pre-Session MCP Setup Checklist**
**Complete BEFORE opening Unity tomorrow to avoid connection hiccups:**

#### **1. Verify Claude Desktop Configuration**
```bash
# Check Claude Desktop config file exists
ls ~/.config/Claude\ Desktop/claude_desktop_config.json

# Or on some systems:
ls ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Required Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/unity-mcp/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "UNITY_PROJECT_PATH": "/home/benton/projects/Unity3d-Projects/PlasmaDragonPrj/PlasmaDragon"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **2. Unity MCP Bridge Verification**
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/benton/projects/Unity3d-Projects/PlasmaDragonPrj/PlasmaDragon

# Check if MCP package is installed
cat Packages/manifest.json | grep -i mcp

# Should show:
# "com.unity.mcp-bridge": "https://github.com/justinpbarnett/unity-mcp.git"
```

#### **3. MCP Server Path Verification**
```bash
# Find Unity MCP server installation
find ~ -name "*unity-mcp*" -type d 2>/dev/null

# Common locations:
# ~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/unity-mcp/
# ~/node_modules/unity-mcp/
# ~/projects/unity-mcp/
```

#### **4. Connection Test Protocol**
**Follow this EXACT sequence tomorrow:**

1. **FIRST: Start Claude Desktop**
   - ✅ Launch Claude Desktop app
   - ✅ Wait for full startup (30 seconds)
   - ✅ Verify MCP server shows in Claude chat

2. **SECOND: Open Unity Project**
   - ✅ Open Unity Hub
   - ✅ Open PlasmaDragon project
   - ✅ Wait for full project load
   - ✅ Check Console for MCP Bridge messages

3. **THIRD: Test MCP Connection**
   - ✅ In Claude: "Can you see my Unity project?"
   - ✅ Expected response: Project details and file structure
   - ✅ Test command: "List the scenes in my project"

### **🔧 Common Connection Issues & Fixes**

#### **Issue 1: "MCP Server Not Found"**
**Symptoms**: Claude can't see Unity project
**Fix**:
```bash
# Restart Claude Desktop completely
pkill -f "Claude Desktop"
sleep 5
# Relaunch Claude Desktop
```

#### **Issue 2: "Unity Project Path Invalid"**
**Symptoms**: MCP connects but can't access files
**Fix**:
```bash
# Verify path exists and has correct permissions
ls -la /home/benton/projects/Unity3d-Projects/PlasmaDragonPrj/PlasmaDragon
# Should show project folders: Assets/, Packages/, ProjectSettings/
```

#### **Issue 3: "Node.js Module Errors"**
**Symptoms**: MCP server crashes on startup
**Fix**:
```bash
# Reinstall Unity MCP Bridge
npm install -g unity-mcp-bridge
# Or if using local installation:
cd ~/path/to/unity-mcp
npm install
```

#### **Issue 4: "Unity MCP Bridge Not Loading"**
**Symptoms**: Unity doesn't show MCP integration
**Fix**:
1. **Window** → **Package Manager**
2. **+ (Plus)** → **Add package from git URL**
3. Enter: `https://github.com/justinpbarnett/unity-mcp.git`
4. **Add**
5. **Restart Unity**

### **🚀 Quick Connection Verification Commands**

**Test these in Claude to verify connection:**

```
✅ "What Unity version is this project using?"
✅ "List the scenes in Assets/_Project/Scenes/"
✅ "Show me the BasicFlightController.cs script"
✅ "Can you see the Combat folder with AI scripts?"
✅ "What's in the IslandBuildScene_001.unity hierarchy?"
```

### **⚡ Emergency Backup Methods**

**If MCP fails completely, use these alternatives:**

#### **Method 1: Direct Unity File Opening**
1. **File** → **Open Scene**
2. Navigate to other Unity project manually
3. Open environment scene directly
4. **File** → **Export Package** (manual export)

#### **Method 2: Manual Asset Copy**
```bash
# Copy assets manually between projects
cp -r /path/to/source/project/Assets/Environment /home/benton/projects/Unity3d-Projects/PlasmaDragonPrj/PlasmaDragon/Assets/_Project/ImportedAssets/
```

#### **Method 3: Unity Collaborate/Version Control**
1. Initialize git in source project
2. Push to temporary repository
3. Clone into PlasmaDragon project as submodule

### **🎯 MCP Success Indicators**

**✅ Connection Working When:**
- Claude can list your Unity scenes
- Claude can read script file contents
- Claude can see project hierarchy
- Claude responds with specific Unity project details
- No error messages in Unity Console

**❌ Connection Broken When:**
- Claude says "I can't see your Unity project"
- Timeout errors in Claude responses
- Unity Console shows MCP Bridge errors
- Claude gives generic responses without project specifics

### **📋 Tomorrow's MCP Startup Checklist**

**Follow this EXACT order:**
- [ ] 1. Close all Unity instances
- [ ] 2. Close Claude Desktop completely
- [ ] 3. Wait 30 seconds
- [ ] 4. Launch Claude Desktop first
- [ ] 5. Wait for full Claude startup
- [ ] 6. Test: "Can you see my Unity project?"
- [ ] 7. If YES → Open Unity project
- [ ] 8. If NO → Run troubleshooting steps above
- [ ] 9. Open PlasmaDragon Unity project
- [ ] 10. Verify MCP commands work in Claude
- [ ] 11. Begin environment scene integration

## 🚨 **Critical Reminders (Proven Effective)**
1. ✅ **DO NOT** import assets directly into Assets/ root (structure maintained)
2. ✅ **DO NOT** forget to switch to WebGL platform (already done!)
3. ✅ **DO** use Unity 6.0 LTS (working perfectly)
4. ✅ **DO NOT** mix custom code with imported assets (clean separation)
5. ✅ **ALWAYS** test MCP commands after Unity restarts (working smoothly)
6. ✅ **NEW: USE MCP SERVER** for environment scene integration (tomorrow's plan)
7. ✅ **FOLLOW Task 18 guidelines** for AI script integration
8. ✅ **NEW: FOLLOW MCP STARTUP CHECKLIST** to avoid connection issues

## 📋 **Environment Integration Checklist (Tomorrow)**
- [ ] Open source Unity project with environment scene
- [ ] Use Unity MCP server to directly access assets
- [ ] Reorganize scene hierarchy to match Task 18 structure
- [ ] Add AI scripts to soldiers, archers, towers
